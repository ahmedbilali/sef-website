            Sakina Education Fund (SEF), is dedicated to support community students residing in Pakistan, on
            need-cum-merit basis. This project is ongoing and is named in rememberance of Hazrat Sakina (s.a), the
            orphaned daughter of Imam Hussain (a.s) who went through many atrocities in Karbala as one of the orphans
            from the family of Ahlulbayt (as).
            <br><br>
            Our aim is to financially assist community students in obtaining higher education and new-world technical
            skills so that they can become self-sufficient and successful in their careers, ultimately benefiting their
            community and country.
            <br><br>
            Based on research and past experience, we have identified that providing quality education can alleviate our
            community from poverty and help raise standard of living which is our long term vision.
            <br><br>
            We achieve our mission by making sure that 100% of the donations are directly paid to the educational
            institutions as fees. The students are required to apply by merit and continue sponsorship based on their
            yearly educational achievements.
            <br><br>
            We are dedicated to bringing hope to the hopeless by creating a brighter future for underprivileged
            community students and their families, providing them with financial, motivational and practical support.
